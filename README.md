## Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) Algorithms

MST algorithms are essential for optimizing networks by minimizing the total edge weight needed to connect all nodes in a weighted undirected graph.

### Kruskal’s Algorithm
- **Approach**: Greedy algorithm using edge sorting and Union-Find.


### Prim’s Algorithm
- **Approach**: Greedy algorithm using priority queues.

## Graph Traversal Techniques

Graph traversal algorithms are used to visit all nodes in a graph systematically, crucial for search operations and network analysis.

### Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Suitable for exploring reachable nodes from a starting point.


### Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Ideal for shortest paths in unweighted graphs.
